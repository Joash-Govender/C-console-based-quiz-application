# C-console-based-quiz-application
This Geography quiz app will help people in areas that have strict Covid-19 regulations will still be able to educate themselves about the world they live in.
On start-up, our program will prompt the user to either view our
  leaderBoard, log in, create an account, report a bug, access our Help
  feature or exit our application
 If
a user does not have an account he/she can then create an account so that he
can start his quiz adventure and  his
progress can be tracked

Once logged on, a user can select an option called Report Bugs,
  whereby if a user encounters some bug or glitch in the game, the developers
  can access this bug reports and improve on the software

 Every
time a specific user tries a quiz, his/her points are added to their leader
board score and then the player is ranked accordingly. We have 3 different
leaderBoards to track easy, medium and hard quizzes as putting all the quiz
results together would not be fair.
